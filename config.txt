##Default view size, in tiles.
##	By default, this is 15x15, which gets simplified to 7 by byond
##  15x15 would be the standard square view. 21x15 is what goonstation uses for widescreen.
##  Setting this to something different from DEFAULT_VIEW_SQUARE will enable widescreen toggles
##	Do note that changing this value will affect the title screen. The title screen will have to be updated manually if this is changed.
DEFAULT_VIEW 19x15
